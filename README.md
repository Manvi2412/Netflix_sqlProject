# Netflix Show Success Predictor

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether a Netflix show will be a **Hit** or **Not Hit** based on features like type, country, cast, director, genres, and IMDb stats. It includes a user-friendly Streamlit web app, a comprehensive SQL analysis, and an exploratory data notebook.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of Netflix content being successful
- Categorical encoding and feature engineering
- Trained using Random Forest Classifier
- SQL-based business insights (15 scenarios)
- Interactive Streamlit UI

## Dataset

The dataset `netflix_titles_with_IMDB.csv` is a merged version of Netflix titles and IMDb metadata. If the full dataset is too large for GitHub, a sample is provided with a link to the full version in the README or repo description.

## SQL Analysis

Inside `analysis/Netflix Analysis.sql`:
- 15 business problem solutions using SQL
- Insightful metrics on content type, country, genre, ratings, and trends

## Jupyter Notebook

`Netflix Analysis.ipynb` performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual EDA to understand patterns in Netflix content and prepare the data for model training.
